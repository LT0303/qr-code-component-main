# README

This is my first project with Frontend Mentor (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component/)! I'm aiming to create a simple QR code page using just HTML and CSS to brush up on my skills with those.

## Overview

This is a simple static page with a QR code leading to Frontend Mentor's website. I mostly stuck to the example images given in terms of design and color palette, but I decided to make it responsive by implementing Flexbox, media queries, and vm/vh em values for element size font size, respectively. I also led with a mobile-first design and set up separate media queries for tablets and desktop/laptop screens.

## My process

I tried to add semantic element tags, the image and text formatting itself (paragraphs) in HTML, then basic CSS before trying to make the page responsive. After that, I implemented Flexbox controls on the body and main card, then refined padding, margin, border radius, and other attributes. Finally, I made two simple media queries for tablet and desktop/laptop screen sizes that targeted the main QR card.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Media queries

### What I learned

I was able to refresh and practice my basic HTML and CSS skills, as well as my Flexbox and media query knowledge. Additionally, I practiced making a responsive site and using Developer Tools to test the site at different screen sizes. Finally, I learned more about markdown files through filling out this README ``:)``
